Hi I;m xx99 I am on the internet

- I am not very good at coding (I exclusively work in Java, and even then I only have a few years of experience), but I've worked with software a fair bit,
- I plan on getting better at coding (I think),
- and I go by any/all pronouns.

(I don't know people don't talk to me)
